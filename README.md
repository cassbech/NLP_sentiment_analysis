# NLP_sentiment_analysis
automate emotional tweet analysis with NLP machine learning

This project, made for a data science consulting company, aims to automate the analysis of tweets for a brand with 3 differents levels : 
positive tweet, neutral tweet or negative tweet.
Several algorithms have been executed to find the best fitting model (decision tree, random forest, bagging etc).

It is built in 3 different parts : 
- scrap tweets from twitter (Tweepy / twitter's API)
- hand labelling of tweets, for supervised machine learning
- machine learning NLP

As an exemple, this code was set to analyse Air France's brand image on Twitter. It includes a scraping py file, the machine learning py file and the functions library py file used for machine learning
